# ðŸ“¹ Real-Time Video Capture & Inference Overlay

This project demonstrates a browser-based real-time video streaming and inference overlay system using WebRTC technology.

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourname/webRTC.git
   cd webRTC
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   - On your phone: Open `http://localhost:3000/phone.html` to use the phone camera
   - On your computer: Open `http://localhost:3000/viewer.html` to see the live feed from the phone with boundaries and predictions

> **Note:** Ensure your phone and computer are on the same network for the connection to work properly.

## ðŸ“± How It Works

This application uses WebRTC to establish a peer-to-peer connection between your phone and computer:

1. The phone camera captures video frames
2. The frames are streamed directly to the viewer
3. The viewer displays the video with overlaid boundaries and predictions

## ðŸ”§ Modes

### Server Mode

Run `node server.js`

- Phone â†’ sends video frames to Node.js server
- Server â†’ relays the video stream
- Viewer â†’ overlays results

## ðŸ“‚ Repo Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ server.js           # Node.js WebSocket relay server
â”œâ”€â”€ public/             # Frontend files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ viewer.html     # Viewer (video + overlay)
